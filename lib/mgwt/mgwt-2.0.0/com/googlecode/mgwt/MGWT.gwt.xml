    <!--
       This module includes all the stuff necessary to use mgwt.
       
       Here, we reset the mobile.user.agent property and define a property-provider
       for it, so as we can test specific mobile stuff, like themes, in desktop browsers.
       To do that, just set the property value of mgwt.os to only one option in your 
       module, for instance:
          <set-property name="mgwt.os" value="iphone" />
       
       Notice that this generates more permutations than including the MGWTMin module.
       @see http://code.google.com/p/mgwt/issues/detail?id=215
