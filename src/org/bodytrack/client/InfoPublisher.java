/**
 * Publishes information to the page outside of the Grapher
 * widget.  This information is available outside of GWT and
 * offers a consistent interface to the rest of the page,
 * regardless of how GWT compiles this widget.
 *
 * <p>This class contains several methods for publishing
 * information to the rest of the page.  They would be
 * static, except that some initialization must be done
 * for the first call into this interface.  As such, this
 * class does not rely on static methods, but is
 * instance-controlled.  There is never more than one instance
 * of this class available at any time.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that race conditions are possible, since this modifies the
 * global state, but race conditions are not a problem with a single
 * thread.  Since JavaScript is single-threaded (notwithstanding the
 * very limited threading model provided by Web Workers), there is
 * no harm in guarantees that only hold for a single-threaded
 * program.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class deals with the public API between the GWT application
 * and the rest of the webpage.  This is through the
 * window.grapherState dictionary, which contains several predefined
 * keys for the interface.  See the {@link #initialize()} method to
 * see the dictionary keys that are available for the rest of the
 * page.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are several informative parts of the API, and one part by
 * which the rest of the page can request to be notified on changes.
 * The window.grapherState[&quot;change_listeners&quot;] part of the
 * API is meant to be an array of no-argument functions.  Whenever a
 * change is made to the informative part of the API, all these functions
 * are called.  They may be called when the actual information does not
 * change, so they are responsible for checking the important
 * information in the window.grapherState variable.</p>
