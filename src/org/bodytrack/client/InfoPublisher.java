/**
 * Publishes information to the page outside of the Grapher
 * widget.  This information is available outside of GWT and
 * offers a consistent interface to the rest of the page,
 * regardless of how GWT compiles this widget.
 *
 * <p>This class contains several methods for publishing
 * information to the rest of the page.  They would be
 * static, except that some initialization must be done
 * for the first call into this interface.  As such, this
 * class does not rely on static methods, but is
 * instance-controlled.  There is never more than one instance
 * of this class available at any time.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that race conditions are possible, since this modifies the
 * global state, but race conditions are not a problem with a single
 * thread.  Since JavaScript is single-threaded (notwithstanding the
 * very limited threading model provided by Web Workers), there is
 * no harm in guarantees that only hold for a single-threaded
 * program.</p>
